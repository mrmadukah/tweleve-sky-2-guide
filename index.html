            <h3>What is Twelve sky 2?</h3>
                <p>Twelve Sky 2 is a fast-paced martial arts MMORPG where you join one of 4 warring factions. The world is full of PvP battles, guild wars, and big faction fights — but you can also grind monsters, level up, and collect gear on your own pace.</p>
                <h3>What's the Main Goal?</h3>
                <p>At first, your goal is simple: level up, learn your skills, and get better gear. As you grow stronger, the game opens up into faction wars, large-scale PvP, and endgame farming, where teamwork and strategy become just as important as your character’s power.</p>
